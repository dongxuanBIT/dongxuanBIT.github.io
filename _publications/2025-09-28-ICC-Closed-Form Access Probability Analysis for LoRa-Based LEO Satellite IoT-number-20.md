Long-range (LoRa) can provide highly energy-efficient and cost-effective communications for low power wide area networks, playing an indispensable role in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, terrestrial LoRa networks cannot guarantee pervasive connectivity, especially in rural and remote areas. To tackle this problem, exploiting LoRa-based low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite IoT has garnered a growing interest in both academia and industry. In this paper, we provide a novel analytical framework based on spherical stochastic geometry (SG) for characterizing the uplink access probability of LoRa-based LEO satellite IoT. For practical modeling, multiple classes of LoRa end-devices (EDs) are taken into consideration, where each class of EDs is modeled by an independent Poisson point process (PPP). Both the channel characteristics of near-Earth satellite communications and the unique features of LoRa network are considered to derive closed-form analytical expressions for the uplink access probability. Numerical simulations validate the accuracy of our theoretical analysis and provide insightful guidelines for the practical design and implementation of LoRa-based LEO satellite IoT.
