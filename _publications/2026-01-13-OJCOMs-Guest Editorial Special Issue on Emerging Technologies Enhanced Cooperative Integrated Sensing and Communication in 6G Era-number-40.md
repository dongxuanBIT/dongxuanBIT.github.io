Sixth Generation (6G) will turn the vision of everything sensing, everything interconnecting, and everything intelligent into reality. That is, the 6G network will have native sensing capability, thus making itself a huge sensor to perceive the physical world ubiquitously. Leveraging radio sensing capability, the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology will utilize wireless signals to realize perception functions such as positioning, detection, imaging, and identification of targets, acquire information about the surrounding physical environment, tap communication capabilities, and enhance user experience. Through endogenous integration of spectrum resource allocation, hardware architecture design, multi-point collaboration, and all-around interaction of information, it can realize green energy saving while realizing communication and sensing capabilities, improve spectrum efficiency and detection accuracy, and ultimately realize the performance enhancement of the whole network.
