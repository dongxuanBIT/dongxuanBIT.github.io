In this letter, we propose a novel spherical stochastic geometry (SG)-based analytical framework to characterize the system-level performance of Long-Range (LoRa)-based low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations. Specifically, tractable analytical expressions for the uplink coverage probability and area spectral efficiency are derived, where the LEO satellite constellations and the terrestrial LoRa end-devices (EDs) are modeled by a binomial point process (BPP) and Poisson point process (PPP), respectively. Numerical simulations not only verify our theoretical analysis but also provide some useful insightsinto the practical implementation of LoRa-based LEO satellite constellations for Internet of Things (IoT) communications.
