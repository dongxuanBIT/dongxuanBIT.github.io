Baseband predistortion is a popular and efficient method to linearize high power amplifier (HPA) in wireless communication systems. Polynomial (POLY) and look-up-table  (LUT) are two methods to design baseband predistorter (PD). However, on the one hand, POLY-based method is complex to implement. On the other hand, LUT-based predistorter suffers convergence time and quantization error problem. In this paper, we propose a hybrid POLY and LUT predistorter for memory nonlinear system in wideband scenarios, it is also suitable for  memoryless channel. Simulations show that the proposed hybrid  structure outperforms the traditional one with lower complexity.
