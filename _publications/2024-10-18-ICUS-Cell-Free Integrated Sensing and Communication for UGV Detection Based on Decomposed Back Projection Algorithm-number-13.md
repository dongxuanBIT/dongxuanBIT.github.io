This paper considers the localization and velocimetry problem of UGV by integrated sensing and communications in a Sub-6GHz cell-free system. Multiple distributed antennas are used to detect a single target and the echo signals are processed. For the receiver processing algorithm, we develop an improved algorithm suitable for real systems to address the problem that the matched-filter based backprojection algorithm consumes too much time. By de-composing range and velocity, the original algorithm is split into range backprojection and velocity backprojection algorithms respectively, and the effective target is identified by constant alarm false rate (CFAR) algorithm. Simulation results show that the improved algorithm increased the computation speed by at least 100 times. For the real system, better results are achieved by proposed algorithm for localization and velocimetry as well.
