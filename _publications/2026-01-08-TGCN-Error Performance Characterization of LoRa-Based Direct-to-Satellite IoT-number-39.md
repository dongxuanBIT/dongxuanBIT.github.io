Long-Range (LoRa) based direct-to-satellite Internet-of-Things (DtS-IoT) has garnered widespread attention from both academia and industry due to its capability to provide pervasive connectivity in an energy-efficient and cost-effective manner. A rigorous error performance analysis of such a new paradigm is quite essential for future green IoT communications. In this paper, we provide a novel analytical framework to characterize the error performance of LoRa-based DtS-IoT systems by leveraging an empirically-verified satellite-to-ground channel model. To enable a realistic performance analysis, non-coherent detection is considered in the presence of interference along with the relative time and frequency offsets, where the corresponding decision metrics are theoretically derived. Based on this, closed-form symbol and bit error rate expressions are obtained by approximating the impact of the overall interference distributed within the decision metrics by that of the peak interference.  Moreover, the impact of some key system parameters, such as the spreading factor (SF), bandwidth, and the end-device's (ED's) location, on the error performance is thoroughly investigated. The validity of our theoretical analysis is substantiated by extensive numerical simulations, where further insights are obtained into the error performance improvements of LoRa-based DtS-IoT.
