In this letter, the low peak to average power ratio (PAPR) precoded waveform design for high mobility communication systems is studied. Based on the time domain equivalent received signal model, a generalized transceiver framework for precoded waveforms is developed, where the computational complexity of the equalizer can be reduced by utilizing the sparse time-delay (TD) domain channel matrix. Further, a minimum signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) maximization precoded waveform scheme is proposed, where the precoder and equalizer are calculated jointly using an alternating optimization algorithm. The proposed precoded waveform also holds low PAPR by constraining the ln -norm of the precoder matrix. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed precoded waveform can achieve better performance than existing waveforms in terms of both PAPR and bit error rate (BER).
