In this work, we consider a wireless legitimate surveillance system, where a multi-antenna legitimate monitor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aims to eavesdrop a suspicious communication link with the help of a jammer UAV. In particular, the flying height of monitor UAV and jammer UAV can be adjusted to obtain a better monitoring performance. To analyze the monitoring performance, the closed-form expressions of the maximum suspicious communication and eavesdropping non-outage probability are derived, which help us analyze the monitoring performance in terms of average eavesdropping rate. Moreover, based on the derived expressions, the flying height of UAVs is selected to optimize the monitoring performance. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of our derived closed-form expressions and our considered UAV-assisted legitimate wireless surveillance.
