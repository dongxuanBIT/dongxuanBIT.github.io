This paper investigates the receiver design for clipped orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) systems, where the user devices are equipped with power amplifiers (PAs) with low dynamic range. To improve power efficiency, the PAs have to work near the saturation points, which leads to unknown nonlinear distortions, thus making the signal detection more challenging. To solve this problem, techniques like intentional clipping or pre-distortion are adopted, thus approximating the outputs of the PAs as clipped signals. To further compensate the unknown time-varying multipath channel and the clipping distortion at the receiver, the channel and clipping amplitude (CA) estimation, channel tracking, and signal detection are studied in this paper. Firstly, a receiver framework is developed for clipped OTFS. Secondly, by adopting the sparsity of the delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel and the piecewise linearized signal model with respect to CA, a novel sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) based joint channel and CA estimation scheme is proposed. Then, to further reduce the estimation error and bit error rate, a Kalman filter (KF) based channel tracking scheme and a minimum mean square error decision feedback block equalization (MMSE-DFBE) based detection scheme are proposed. These two schemes are integrated in an expectation maximization (EM) based iterative tracking and detection algorithm. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes in terms of both estimation error and bit error rate.
