The rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has given rise to the new concept low-altitude economy, driving innovations in diverse applications. However, the implementation of low-altitude economy relies heavily on the communication ability of UAVs. In this article, we first overview representative application scenarios of the low-altitude economy, particularly focusing on the role of UAV communications in these scenarios. Next, this article presents the typical architecture of the UAV network, which integrates both non-terrestrial and terrestrial components to enable ubiquitous connectivity, and also highlights the key technologies that ensure seamless, reliable communications within UAV networks. Furthermore, the article examines the role of 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards in the development of UAV communication, as well as the effort of 3GPP. By analyzing both the technological advancements and standardization efforts, the article provides insights into the challenges and opportunities for UAV communication in the evolving low-altitude economy, with a view towards future deployment and regulation.
