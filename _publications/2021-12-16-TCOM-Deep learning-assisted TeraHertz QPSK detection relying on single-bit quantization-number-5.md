TeraHertz (THz) wireless communication constitutes a promising technique of satisfying the ever-increasing appetite for high-rate services. However, the ultra-wide bandwidth of THz communications requires high-speed, high-resolution analog-to-digital converters, which are hard to implement due to their high complexity and power consumption. In this paper, a deep learning-assisted THz receiver is designed, which relies on single-bit quantization. Specifically, the imperfections of THz devices, including their in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalance, phase noise and nonlinearity are investigated. The deflection ratio of the maximum-likelihood detector used by our single-bit-quantization THz receiver is derived, which reveals the effect of phase offset on the demodulation performance, guiding the architecture design of our proposed receiver. To combat the performance loss caused by the above-mentioned distortions, a twin-phase training strategy and a neural network based demodulator are proposed, where the phase offset of the received signal is compensated before sampling. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning-assisted receiver is capable of achieving a satisfactory bit error rate performance, despite the grave distortions encountered.
