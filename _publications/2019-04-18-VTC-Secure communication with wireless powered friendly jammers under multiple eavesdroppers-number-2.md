In this work, we propose a secure communication scheme, where a source transmits information to the legitimate receiver in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. To improve the security, single or multiple friendly jammers are deployed to confuse the eavesdroppers. Specifically, we assume that the jammers have to harvest energy from the source, thus we consider a two-phase transmission scheme where the source transmits energy to the jammers first and then transmits information to the legitimate receiver confidentially with the help of the jammers. We first give the expression of the secrecy outage probability, revealing how the secrecy performance depends on the transmission parameter tuple, and then we use the simulated annealing method to obtain the optimal transmission parameter tuple. The simulation results show the superiority of our proposed scheme.
