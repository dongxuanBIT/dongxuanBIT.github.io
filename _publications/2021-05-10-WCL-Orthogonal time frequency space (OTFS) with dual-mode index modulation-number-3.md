Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has been proved to have better bit error rate (BER) performance over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) under high-mobility conditions. In this letter, a new transmission scheme, called OTFS with dual-mode index modulation (OTFS-DM-IM), is proposed to balance the transmission reliability and spectral efficiency. Moreover, a modified log likelihood ratio (LLR) detector based on the minimum Hamming distance is designed for demodulation. Then, the theoretical BER analysis of the proposed OTFS-DM-IM is presented. Simulation results highlight the performance advantage of OTFS-DM-IM over classical OTFS and the existing OTFS systems based on index modulation (OTFS-IM), and also confirm the superiority of the modified LLR detector compared to maximum likelihood detector and conventional LLR detector.
