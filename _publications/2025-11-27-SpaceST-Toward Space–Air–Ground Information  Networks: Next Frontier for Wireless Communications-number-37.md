Given the ever-increasing demand for emerging services exemplified by wide-area Internet of Things, submarine communication, etc., flexible and seamless coverage has been regarded as an urgent need for the upcoming sixth generation. Therefore, different types of space/air/terrestrial platforms need to be connected to existing terrestrial networks to break the isolation of information islands and provide various services. Specifically, as a powerful supplement for terrestrial networks, airborne and space communication infrastructures, such as low-Earth orbit satellite constellations and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are envisioned to be integrated to provide efficient information transmission with expanded coverage and satisfying quality of service, anywhere and anytime. However, due to limited resources and the dynamic topology of both satellites and UAVs, there is a need to develop new communication architectures and protocols to complement and extend space–air–ground networks.
