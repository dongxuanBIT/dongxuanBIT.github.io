Orthogonal time frequency space-integrated sensing and communication (OTFS-ISAC) has recently emerged as a focal point of research within the development of sixth generation (6G) networks, due to its unique advantages in high mobility scenarios. In this article, we focus on the parameter estimation problem of sensing targets in the OTFS-ISAC system. Firstly, we introduce the system framework of OTFS-ISAC. Then, a review is conducted on the parameter estimation methods of sensing targets in OTFS-ISAC. Furthermore, technical challenges that OTFS-ISAC may face are outlined, as well as the future research directions. Finally, we provide several emerging applications for OTFS-ISAC and make statements on the parameter estimation of sensing targets in these scenarios.
